    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In the movie, Sophie, an 18-year-old unconfident young woman, is cursed with an <br>old body by a spiteful witch
        and
        her only chance of breaking the spell lies with <br>a self-indulgent yet insecure young wizard and his
        companions,
        Mark and Calcifer, <br>in his legged, walking castle.</p>
    <p>As Sophie steps into Howl's moving castle, she's greeted warmly by Howl,
        Mark, <br>and Calcifer who all work to present her with a delicious looking breakfast to start their day!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large piece of pork belly (about 3 lbs), skin removed</li>
        <li>4 1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 1/2 tsp coarsely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>6 packaged tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup distilled water</li>
        <li>1 tsp pink curing salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp applewood</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cherrywood</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>sliced bread</li>
        <li>cheese of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure your pork belly is cut to size so that it will fit in the Ziploc bag you are marinating <br>it in.
            Also make sure
            that the skin has been removed from the pork belly.</li>
        <li>Combine kosher salt, coarsely ground black pepper, brown sugar, distilled water, and curing salt <br>in a
            bowl.
            Mix until
            everything is combined.</li>
        <li>Put pork belly into the Ziploc bag and add the curing solution. Squeeze as much air out of the bag <br>as
            possible before
            sealing. Place the bag in a high walled container (like a casserole dish) to prevent <br>cross
            contamination.
            Put the dish
            in the fridge for 3-5 days, flipping once per day.</li>
        <li>To use a stovetop smoker, start by adding 2 Tbsp applewood and 2 Tbsp cherrywood to the bottom <br>of the
            smoker. Top that
            with the drip plate, followed by the roasting rack. Lastly place the pork belly <br>on top of the roasting
            rack.
            Cover the
            entire stovetop smoker with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Add the stovetop smoker to a burner over medium heat. Insert a temperature probe into the pork belly <br>so
            that
            you can
            monitor the internal temperature. Once it has been smoking for 30-45 minutes, move <br>the entire pan to the
            oven.</li>
        <li>Finish the pork belly in a 225°F oven for another hour, or until it reaches 150°F internally. Place the
            <br>meat
            in a Ziploc
            bag and chill for about 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>When completely chilled, remove the bacon from the bag and slice strips to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Fry strips of bacon in a cast iron skillet over medium low heat. This keeps the bacon from burning <br>while
            the
            fat renders
            out.</li>
        <li>Once the fat has rendered out, add 4 cracked eggs to the pan. Cook until the eggs have a good crust <br>on
            them.
            If the
            whites need to cook more, kill the heat to the pan and cover with a lid to steam <br>the tops of the egg
            whites.
        </li>
        <li>Serve the eggs and bacon with some sliced bread and cheese and a good sprinkle of salt and pepper. <br>Enjoy
            before going off to break a curse from the evil witch!</li>
    </ol>
