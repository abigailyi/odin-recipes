    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In the movie, a little girl named Chihiro must work in a mysterious spa for magical spirits <br>while attempting
        to find her enchanted parents (they've been transformed into pigs<br>--who may soon be served for dinner to the
        magical guests!)</p>
    <p>When Chihiro becomes overewhelmed and despairs of ever freeing herself and her parents, <br>her friend Haku
        offers her a Japanese rice ball (called "onigiri"). As she eats, she calms down <br>and renews her resolve to
        defeat the sorceress and rescue her parents.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 mini sheets of roasted seaweed (also called "nori")</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of shredded, cooked salmon</li>
        <li>1 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
        <li>6 cups cooked sticky rice</li>
        <li>1 triangle shaped cookie cutter (or onigiri mold)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by slicing your nori sheets in half lengthwise. Cut into 12 strips about 1 1/4" wide.</li>
        <li>Mix the mayonnaise into your salmon until well coated. Make sure to break the salmon filet <br>into small
            chunks
            beforehand. Set aside the salmon mix and nori.</li>
        <li>While your rice is slightly warm, not hot, put your cookie cutter or onigiri mold on a flat surface.
            <br>Place
            an 8" x 8" sheet of plastic wrap over the cookie cutter and push some of it down inside <br>so that the
            inside
            of the cookie cutter is completely lined with plastic wrap.
        </li>
        <li>Scoop approximately 2 tbsp of rice into the bottom of the cutter and press it flat with a spoon or <br>small
            rubber spatula. Push the rice around to fill in your cutter/mold to make sure the bottom is <br>completely
            filled.</li>
        <li>Place 1 tsp salmon filling into the middle of the rice, spreading it around just a little, so there will
            <br>be
            a little salmon in each bite of rice when you're finished.
        </li>
        <li>Place a couple more tablespoons of rice on top and flatten out like before. Wrap the plastic tightly
            <br>over
            the exposed end of the onigiri and set it aside.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining rice and salmon until you run out of ingredients. Let the onigiri <br>set for 5-10
            minutes.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, remove the plastic wrap and press a nori strip around the bottom of <br>each onigiri.
            The
            rice should still be sticky enough that the nori adheres with no problems.</li>
        <li>Serve at a spa for magical creatures while brainstorming ideas to save your loved ones!</li>
    </ol>
